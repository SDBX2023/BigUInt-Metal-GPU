# BigUInt-Metal-GPU
A Big or Large Integer Framework Library Designed for GPUs using Metal, interfaced via Apple Swift.

# Did You Know?
Your GPU is more than likely better at Mathematics ðŸ§® Throughput than your CPU?

*For example*:
 - An Intel Core i9-9880H processor (8C/16T) can perform 432.2 GFLOPS (Giga, or Billion, Floating Point Operations per Second).
 - An AMD Radeon Pro 5500M (GPU: 1536 shaders) can perform ~4454 GFLOPS which is over 10x times the throughput.
 - Both of these devices are inside the Apple MacBook Pro 16"-inch (model: Late 2019).
